# RenpyTrTk
Ren'Py Translation Toolkit

## Project

This little script helps people who are translating renpy games monitoring their progression and checking the file's
integrity. Provided you are willing to get into the code, you will find a parser that can help you manipulate the
translation blocks, for example :
 - extract lines of a certain language
 - get all lines from a specific character
 - extract translator's comments
 - transfer lines between different versions of a same file
As is, the script outputs your progression regarding the number of items and the length of what has been translated.

## Usage

`python renpytrtk.py -i myfile.rpy`
